        <p class="text2">Web design is the process of creating the visual and interactive aspects of a website. It
            involves a combination of aesthetic considerations, user experience (UX) design, and technical skills. Here
            are some key aspects of web design:

            Layout and Structure:

            Designers plan the arrangement of elements on a webpage, including navigation menus, headers, content areas,
            and footers.
            Color Palette and Typography:

            Choosing an appropriate color scheme and typography contributes to the overall look and feel of the website.
            Consistent use of colors and fonts helps establish brand identity.
            Graphics and Multimedia:

            Incorporating images, videos, and other multimedia elements enhances the visual appeal and engagement of a
            website.
            User Experience (UX) Design:

            UX design focuses on creating a seamless and enjoyable experience for users. This includes considerations
            for navigation, accessibility, and user interface elements.
            Responsive Design:

            Designers ensure that websites are accessible and functional across various devices, including desktop
            computers, tablets, and mobile phones.
            Wireframing and Prototyping:

            Designers create wireframes and prototypes to visualize the layout and functionality of a website before it
            is developed.</p>
