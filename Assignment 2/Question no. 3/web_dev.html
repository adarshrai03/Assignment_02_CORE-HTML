            <h2>About web development</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text1">
            Web development involves the creation and maintenance of websites and web applications. It encompasses
            various tasks, including designing the user interface, writing code for functionality, and optimizing
            performance. Here are some key aspects of web development:

            Front-End Development:

            HTML (Hypertext Markup Language): It provides the structure and content of a webpage.
            CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): It controls the layout, appearance, and style of a webpage.
            JavaScript: It adds interactivity and dynamic elements to a webpage.
            Back-End Development:

            Server-Side Languages (e.g., Python, Ruby, PHP, Java, Node.js): These handle server operations, database
            interactions, and application logic.
            Databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB): They store and retrieve data for the web application.
            Frameworks and Libraries:

            Front-End: Tools like React, Angular, and Vue.js provide pre-built components and structures to streamline
            front-end development.
            Back-End: Frameworks like Django (Python), Ruby on Rails (Ruby), and Express.js (Node.js) offer pre-built
            modules and patterns for server-side development.
            Full-Stack Development:

            Full-stack developers work on both the front-end and back-end of a web application. They can handle the
            entire development process from start to finish.
            Responsive Design:

            Ensuring websites are user-friendly on various devices (desktops, tablets, mobile phones) is crucial for a
            positive user experience.
